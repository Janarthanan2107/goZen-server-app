# React Project with Vite

This is a simple React project bootstrapped with Vite, a fast build tool that significantly improves the development experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Janarthanan2107/goZen-server-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd goZen-server-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or if you prefer yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

### Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run your React application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.

The page will automatically reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Production Build

To build your application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of your application in the `dist` directory.

### Additional Commands

- `npm run serve`: Serve the production build locally for testing.
- `npm run lint`: Lint your code using ESLint.
- `npm run format`: Format your code using Prettier.

### Folder Structure

The project structure might look something like this:

```
goZen-react-app/
  ├── node_modules/
  ├── public/
  │   ├── index.html
  │   └── ...
  ├── src/
  │   ├── components/
  │   │   └── ...
  │   ├── App.jsx
  │   └── index.jsx
  ├── .gitignore
  ├── package.json
  ├── README.md
  └── vite.config.js
```

Feel free to organize your code differently based on your preferences or project requirements.
